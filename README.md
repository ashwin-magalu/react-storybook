## What and why?

- A development environment and playground for UI components
- Create components independently
- Showcase those components interactively in an isolated development environment
- Ability to view the different components that have already been deployed
- View what are the different props that those developed components accept
- Ability to visually showcase those components to your stake holders for feedback
- Dynamically change the props, accessibility score

## Setup
